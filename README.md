# üëã Hi there! I'm 2bitninja

I'm an experienced IT professional with a focus on system administration, security, and automation. My expertise spans across Unix and Linux environments, where I leverage shell scripting, Python, and Splunk to optimize and secure systems. I'm passionate about creating efficient, secure, and automated solutions that streamline operations and improve system defenses.

## üåê Projects
My projects span across Security Optimization, Automation Scripting, Web Development, and more. Below is a quick overview:
### Security Optimization: 
I‚Äôve created tools that enhance security operations by automating the verification and sanitization processes to ensure systems are secure and compliant.
  - **check-scan**: Verifies Tenable.sc and Nessus scans to confirm proper credentialing. This tool streamlines the vulnerability management process, ensuring thoroughness and accuracy in scan results.
  - **sanitize**: Helps users remove personal, corporate, or sensitive data from files, ensuring privacy when files are shared externally.
  - **Various Hardening Scripts**: Implements Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs) to harden systems. Most are in private repos, but some snippets are available in the code-snippets repository.
  
### Automation Scripting:
Automating routine processes using scripts to improve operational efficiency and accuracy.
  - **mass_rename**: Renames large groups of files, particularly useful for managing media libraries in Jellyfin, Plex, and Emby by following naming conventions for easier metadata collection.
  - **ipsweep**: Scans subnets to identify active devices or available IP addresses. Useful for network administrators and security professionals to map assets in a network.

### Web Development: 
Projects aimed at creating functional, user-friendly web interfaces.
 - **web-archive**: Contains old web projects that demonstrate my work in designing accessible and user-centric interfaces.
### Miscellaneous Scripts
- **PythonAudiobookGenerator**: Converts text files into audiobooks with Python.
- **m-mail**: A command-line email application designed for sending emails efficiently.
- **se-mail**: Sends emails to vendor support systems to create trouble tickets automatically.
